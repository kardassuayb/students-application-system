In this project,

I chose Next.js (App Router) to benefit from SEO advantages and fast rendering.
I used Redux Toolkit Query in API requests.
I used the Tailwind library for styling.
I created it completely responsive.

I prepared the API data used throughout the project using mockAPI.

Since I did not have an Auth API source, I could not benefit from libraries such as nextAuth, but I simulated the users' Auth status throughout the project with requests sent to the API.

I used react features such as useState, useEffect and Next properties such as useSearchParams, Link, Image and so on..

I used the react-data-table-component library to list the data in the table;
https://react-data-table-component.netlify.app/
I used the FontAweSome library for icons;
https://fontawesome.com/
I used the daisyUI library for the header interface;
https://daisyui.com/





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
